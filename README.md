# simapi-platform
Cloud-based co-simulation framework between for benchmark and assess the benefits of demand response control algorithms using building energy modelling software. The SimApi platform is designed to interface a building simulation system to a control algorithm in a programming language agnostic method exploiting a cloud interface based on the \gls{API}. The objective is to abstract the operation of the building actuators from the controller, thereby decoupling the control algorithm from the building model.  A simulation can be triggered via the \gls{API} or the associated web dashboard to assess the baseline scenario.
